# Mario Off

A competition app for mario, but probably works for other places too

## Techincal stuff
To test stuff locally `npm run dev` and then go to the localhost given.

For css to compile from postcss, `npm run watch`. This will autocompile the `/postcss/index.css` file into `/scr/index.css`, so only edit the former file and never the latter.

To only compile the project without running to localhost, `npm run build`. This will compile the css and then run the project.

To publish to github pages `npm run deploy` (deploys to separate branch auto-magically)
