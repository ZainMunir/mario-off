# Mario off

A competition app made for Super Mario games, but probably works for other places too

## Techincal stuff
To test stuff locally `npm run dev` and then go to the localhost given.

To only compile the project without running to localhost, `npm run build`.

To publish to github pages `npm run deploy` (deploys to separate branch auto-magically).

To deploy with firebase hosting `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass firebase deploy` (should probably make it so I don't need the first bit)
